            SOS, Students Opposing Substances, is a student-founded and student-driven non-profit organization that gives students the upper hand in 
            peer pressure related drug-use. The U.S Department of Health and Human Services says, "By the twelfth grade, about half of adolescents 
            have abused an illicit drug at least once." SOS is a tool to aid the teen in a peer pressure situation and an answer to a world wide cry 
            for help from our future generations. To put it simple, it is a reason to say no, it is a commitment to stay clean, and it is putting our 
            future into our own hands. For more information. please contact us at <a href="info@studentsopposingsubstances.com">info@studentsopposingsubstances.com</a></asp:Panel>
